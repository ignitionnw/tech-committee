## Our RFC (Request For Comments) process
The Tech Committee makes small decisions about technology policy or
infrastructure after one or two conversations at our regular monthly
Tech Committee Meeting.

For major changes to policy or infrastructure, where the decision is complex,
brings long term impacts, has many stakeholders, or requires substantial
resources, we explore ideas and refine proposals using the RFC process that
has served as the collaborative technical foundation of the (literal, capital
I) Internet since the beginning, and is implemented today in some form today
by almost every significant technology community.

**If you need help with any of this, ask around on the Tech Committee.**

  - Fork the [Tech Committee repo]
  - Copy `0000-template.md` to `text/0000-my-proposal.md` (where "my-proposal"
    is descriptive). Don't assign an RFC number yet; this happens shortly.
  - Fill in the RFC. The target audience is not just the current Tech Committee&mdash;
    it includes the entire INW community as well as our current and future selves.
  - Submit a pull request.
  - Now that your RFC has an open pull request, use the issue number of the PR
    to rename your copy of the RFC file from the `0000-` prefix to that PR
    number.
  - Use the Pull Request process to discuss and refine the proposal, and
    answer any questions that may arise.
  - With the Tech Committee, work to determine whether there are stakeholders
    whose feedback should be actively solicited.
  - Once the Tech Committee feels the RFC is ready to become a recommendation,
    the Tech Committee can put it in a committee report to bring to the Board
    for approval.
    
    Alternatively, the Tech Committee (or the Board), may decide that now
    is not the right time for the proposal, or that the tradeoffs aren't quite
    right for the current state of the organization. This is not an indication
    that your proposal was bad. Your effort to develop the proposal will
    live on in the Pull Request history for our future selves and our
    successors to refer to, and possibly implement at the right moment!
