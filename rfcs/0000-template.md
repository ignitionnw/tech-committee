# Summary

Brief explanation of the proposal.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Detailed Proposal

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain your proposal in enough detail for our
community (not just the Tech Committee and Board) to understand. This
should get into specifics and edge-cases. Any terminology likely to be
unfamiliar to a moderately technical end user should be defined.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, in terms of time, dollars, and complexity
- whether it's truly a problem that should be solved centrally by INW, or if
  it should be solved by an event or the community instead
- are there technical (or social or political) risks to doing this

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other ideas have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior Art

Are there other organizations like ours with similar problems? Have they
attempted a solution like this one, or any alternatives? What can we learn
from their experience?

# Implementation Plan

What will it take to put this proposal into practice? How much will it cost up
front? How much recurring? How do we expect that to change over time?

What skills (not just technical) will we need for the initial implementation?
To whom will we need to communicate the change? How? When?

# Accessibility

Who will the end users be for this proposal (there may be multiple
types of stakeholders who interact with the proposal differently such as
admin, board, production, or community member)?

What level of technical ability will be required for each of these groups? How
will we train them?

Are there any other accessibility considerations with this proposal?

# Sustainability

What technologies (platforms, licenses, subscriptions, dependencies, all of them!)
does this depend on? Why are we confident that this is a good long term bet? For
that matter, how long is "long term"? ðŸ™ƒ

What happens as the organization turns over? How will we ensure that newcomers will
be able to continue getting value out of this?

What skills (not just technical) will be required to continue getting value
out of this proposal over its aspirational lifetime?

# Sunset

What happens when this proposal inevitably becomes obsolete?

What would we lose if it got shut down with no notice? How would we recover?

How do we voluntarily wind down this proposal if we later learn that it wasn't
the right idea? Is there an obvious, well-supported, and convenient way for us to
export and preserve our data and other organizational assets that we have
accumulated under this proposal?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the proposal are still
TBD?
